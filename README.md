# 3D_Gen
# 3D Model Generation with RAG

Generate 3D printable models from text descriptions using DeepSeek-V3 enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Quick Start

1. **Edit Prompts**: Open `3D_Gen.py` and modify the shape description prompt
2. **Run the Generator**: `python 3D_Gen.py`
3. **Get Results**: STL files are saved in the output directory

```python
# Example shape generation
python 3D_Gen.py --shape "hollow cylinder with radius 15mm, height 40mm, wall thickness 2mm"
```

## Features

- Generate 3D printable STL files from text descriptions
- Support for hollow shapes with precise dimensions
- Built-in validation for printability
- Measurement tools for dimensional accuracy

## Repository Structure

- `3D_Gen.py` - Main generation script (edit this to create your models)
- `stl_analyzer.py` - Tool for measuring generated models
- `run_evaluation.py` - Full evaluation system used in the research
- `evaluation_results_date/` - Folder containing models and results generated by the system from our two main evaluations


## Advanced Usage

For researchers interested in evaluating RAG performance for 3D model generation, see the detailed [RAG Evaluation README](evaluation/README.md) which documents the experimental setup used in our research.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Trimesh
- numpy-stl
- DeepSeek API key (for code generation)

```bash
pip install openai requests beautifulsoup4 sentence-transformers faiss-cpu trimesh numpy numpy-stl pyglet manifold3d shapely pandas matplotlib seaborn
